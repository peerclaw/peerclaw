  - New components: PublicLayout, AgentDirectoryCard, ReputationMeter, VerifiedBadge, ReputationChart
  - Recharts-based reputation history visualization

## Phase 7: Agent Marketplace (Complete)

Evolve PeerClaw into a C2C Agent Marketplace — where anyone can publish an Agent as a service, and anyone (human or Agent) can discover and invoke it.

### Phase 7a: Marketplace Browse & Profile

Public-facing marketplace for discovering and evaluating Agents.

- [x] **Landing page** — Platform stats, value propositions, search entry point (shipped in Phase 6)
- [x] **Explore page** — Agent Directory with search, filter (verified, min_score), and sort (reputation, name, registered_at) (shipped in Phase 6)
- [x] **Agent Profile page** — Detailed view with capabilities, protocols, trust info, reputation history chart (shipped in Phase 6)
- [x] **Top navigation bar** — PublicLayout with horizontal nav, distinct from admin sidebar (shipped in Phase 6)
- [x] **Mobile-responsive design** — Responsive card-based layout with AgentDirectoryCard (shipped in Phase 6)
- [x] **Extended query API** — `category` filter on directory endpoint, full-text `search` param

### Phase 7b: Playground & Invocation

Let consumers try and invoke Agents through a protocol-agnostic interface.

- [x] **Protocol-agnostic invocation endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/invoke/{agent_id}`, auto-selects optimal protocol (A2A / MCP / ACP) via Bridge Manager
- [x] **Chat-style Playground** — Web UI for trying Agents live, with developer mode toggle for raw request/response inspection
- [x] **SSE streaming** — `stream: true` in invoke request, `Content-Type: text/event-stream` response with `http.Flusher`
- [x] **Anonymous rate-limited trial** — Playground access without login, rate-limited per IP (10 calls/hour, burst 3)
- [x] **Invocation record logging** — `internal/invocation/` module records every call (agent, caller, protocol, latency, status, error) with SQLite/PostgreSQL persistence

### Phase 7c: User Accounts & Provider Console

User identity and Agent management for providers.

- [x] **User registration & login** — Email/password with bcrypt hashing (`internal/userauth/`)
- [x] **JWT session management** — Access token (15m) + refresh token (168h) with automatic rotation, `internal/userauth/jwt.go`
- [x] **Agent publish wizard** — Guided 5-step registration (basic info → capabilities & protocols → endpoint → auth & metadata → preview)
- [x] **Provider Dashboard** — My agents overview with total calls, success rate, average latency
- [x] **API key management** — Generate, list, and revoke API keys with SHA-256 hashing, prefix display
- [x] **Interaction history** — Consumer and provider views of past invocations with filtering

### Phase 7d: Trust & Community

Community-driven trust signals and provider analytics.

- [x] **Reviews & ratings** — Star ratings (1-5) + text reviews with UNIQUE(agent_id, user_id) constraint, reputation integration (rating ≥ 4 → review_positive, ≤ 2 → review_negative)
- [x] **Verified / Trusted badges** — "Verified" via endpoint verification, "Trusted" badge for verified + reputation > 0.8
- [x] **Categories & tagging** — Structured categorization with `categories` + `agent_categories` tables, category filter on directory
- [x] **Provider analytics dashboard** — Call volume time series, agent stats (total/success/error calls, avg/p95 duration)
- [x] **Abuse reporting** — Report system for agents and reviews with reason + details, status tracking (pending/reviewed/dismissed/actioned)

## Post-Phase 7: P2P Connection Orchestrator (Complete)

Close the gap between signaling infrastructure and automatic P2P connectivity.

- [x] **Connection Manager** (`agent/conn/`)
  - Signaling inbox consumption loop (offer / answer / ICE candidate dispatch)
  - Offerer flow: create WebRTCTransport → exchange SDP + ICE via signaling → block until DataChannel opens
  - Answerer flow: respond with SDP answer, tie-breaking by agent ID
  - ICE connection state monitoring → auto-register peer on Connected/Completed
  - Receive loop: read envelopes from DataChannel, dispatch to message handler
  - X25519 public key exchange in offer/answer for E2E encrypted sessions
- [x] **Agent Send() P2P-first with relay fallback**
  - Priority 1: existing P2P connection via PeerManager
  - Priority 2: establish new P2P connection via ConnManager (15s timeout)
  - Priority 3: signaling relay via bridge_message (WebSocket server relay)
- [x] **Signaling reconnection**
  - Auto-reconnect on unexpected WebSocket disconnection
  - Exponential backoff (1s → 60s)
- [x] **SignalingClient.SetAgentID()** — Deferred agent ID binding (set after registration, before Connect)
