- [x] **Chat-style Playground** — Web UI for trying Agents live, with developer mode toggle for raw request/response inspection
- [x] **SSE streaming** — `stream: true` in invoke request, `Content-Type: text/event-stream` response with `http.Flusher`
- [x] **Anonymous rate-limited trial** — Playground access without login, rate-limited per IP (10 calls/hour, burst 3)

## Post-Phase 7: P2P Connection Orchestrator (Complete)

Close the gap between signaling infrastructure and automatic P2P connectivity.

- [x] **Connection Manager** (`agent/conn/`)
  - Signaling inbox consumption loop (offer / answer / ICE candidate dispatch)
  - Offerer flow: create WebRTCTransport → exchange SDP + ICE via signaling → block until DataChannel opens
  - Answerer flow: respond with SDP answer, tie-breaking by agent ID
  - ICE connection state monitoring → auto-register peer on Connected/Completed
  - Receive loop: read envelopes from DataChannel, dispatch to message handler

  - Server-side: ContactsChecker interface on signaling Hub — blocks offer/answer/ICE for non-contacts
  - Contacts service wired into signaling hub at server startup
- [x] **Connection gating**
  - ConnectionGate callback in conn.Manager — checked before any WebRTC resource allocation
  - Inbound offers from non-whitelisted peers are silently dropped (zero resource cost)
  - Outbound Connect() also checks gate before initiating WebRTC handshake
  - Gate combines TrustStore check + owner-registered ConnectionRequestHandler callback
- [x] **Contact management API**
  - `AddContact(agentID)` — whitelist a peer (TrustVerified)

## Phase 15e: ACP Stdio Bridge (Complete)

ndJSON/stdio bridge enabling ACP-compatible agents (OpenClaw, Zed AI, Coder) to join the PeerClaw network via local process communication.

- [x] **`peerclaw acp serve` command** — ndJSON/stdio bridge process, reads ACP requests from stdin and writes responses to stdout, proxying to PeerClaw server's ACP HTTP bridge
- [x] **ACP method dispatch** — 6 methods: `create_run` (POST /acp/{agent_id}/runs), `get_run` (with local cache), `cancel_run`, `list_agents` (directory → ACP manifest conversion), `get_agent`, `ping`
- [x] **Lightweight ACP types** — JSON-compatible copies of server ACP types (Run, Message, MessagePart, AgentManifest) in CLI package, no server module dependency
- [x] **Run caching** — Local sync.Map cache for created runs, reducing server round-trips on get_run
- [x] **Tests** — 10 unit tests (ping, invalid JSON, unknown method, create_run, get_run, get_run cached, cancel_run, list_agents, get_agent, blank lines) + 2 command tests

## Phase 16: P2P File Transfer (Complete)

Pure peer-to-peer large file transfer with E2E encryption — zero server dependency in the data path.

- [x] **WebRTC transport enhancement** — `CreateDataChannel()`, `RegisterDataChannelHandler()` for dedicated file transfer channels, backpressure control (1MB high-water, 256KB low-water) in `Send()`
- [x] **File transfer message types** — `file_offer`, `file_accept`, `file_reject`, `transfer_ready`, `transfer_complete`, `chunk_ack`, `resume_request`, `file_chunk` in `core/envelope/filetransfer.go`
- [x] **Binary frame protocol** — `[seq:4B][length:4B][flags:1B][encrypted_chunk]` with FlagData, FlagFIN, FlagACK; 64KB default chunk size
- [x] **Transfer state machine** — `Idle → Offered → Accepted → Transferring → Completing → Done/Failed/Cancelled` with per-state timeouts
- [x] **Challenge-response mutual auth** — 3-step Ed25519 handshake: FileOffer(challenge) → FileAccept(challenge_sig, counter_challenge) → TransferReady(counter_sig)
- [x] **Pipeline push sender** — Dedicated `ft-{file_id}` DataChannel (ordered, reliable), per-chunk XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption with AAD = `file_id|seq`, FIN frame on completion
- [x] **Streaming receiver** — Binary frame decode → decrypt → write to file, periodic ChunkAck every 100 chunks, full-file SHA-256 verification on FIN
- [x] **Resume support** — `SaveResumeState()` / `LoadResumeState()` persist last-confirmed sequence to disk, `ResumeRequest` continues from `last_seq + 1`
- [x] **Nostr relay fallback** — When WebRTC ICE fails, chunks sent as encrypted Nostr events (~40KB/event) via standard `agent.Send()` path
- [x] **Mailbox wakeup** — FileOffer via mailbox sends `MessageTypeMailboxWakeup` to trigger immediate `SyncInbox()` instead of waiting for poll interval
- [x] **Agent integration** — `SendFile()`, `ListTransfers()`, `GetTransfer()`, `CancelTransfer()` public API; capability handler registered as `"file_transfer"`; `FileTransferDir` and `ResumeStatePath` options
- [x] **CLI commands** — `peerclaw send-file --to <id> --file <path>` with progress polling; `peerclaw transfer status [--transfer-id <id>]` for transfer listing
- [x] **Blob service removal** — Removed centralized `server/internal/blob/` package and all references; file transfer is now purely P2P
